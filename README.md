## Abstract

<p align="justify">

The research study investigated the relationship between posture and RSA values. Electrodes were placed on seven adult male participants aged 18-24 with no known breathing issues. Participants inhaled and exhaled at a constant rate for 2 minutes in 3 different bodily postures which included standing, sitting and lying down. The ECG signal was recorded at each posture generating the heart rate and breathing rate. The difference between heart rate when exhaling verses inhaling was compared. These results from the BioRadio were plotted as a function of time to calculate the RSA. A t-test was performed and average RSA values of 1.8763, 3.5437 and 4.0473 were obtained for supine, sitting and standing positions respectively. Despite these small RSA values, the results had further acknowledged the effect on RSA and that it was the most eminent in the standing position. For future prosperous studies, the role of bodily postures in overall heart health could be investigated to find solutions to heart diseases with a greater sample testing size to provide greater confidence levels within the results.
